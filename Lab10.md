36-200 Lab 10
6/21

In the lab, we'll practice developing and answering research scenarios where now we can make decisions and conclusions using statistical evidence in the form of a confidence interval hypothesis test.  

We're using a data set containing information about patients with heart disease and related complications.  In particular, this information was collected in order to determine which factors were associated with the total cost associated with medical care that was charged to the insurance company. 

1) Take a few minutes to look through the data set (upper left tab) and the variable descriptions (lower right button on the Data tab) to familiarize yourself with our research problem.

2) Now we'll take a look at some research scenarios/hypotheses.  Recalling our in-class discussion about the steps of our hypothesis test, we'll 

a) state our hypotheses
b) analyze and summarize our sample data
c) look for evidence for/against our null hypothesis (original idea)
d) make a decision


**First scenario:  Previous studies have indicated that the average cost to insurance companies for patients with heart disease is $2750.  Is the average cost in your patient population different?

a) Put down your null and alternative hypotheses



b) Create a graph that describes and summarizes the distribution of cost.  
Put the graph below.  Then describe your graph in 2-3 sentences.








Now calculate the average cost and the standard deviation of cost for your sample.  Include them below.




Now use your sample information to calculate a 90% confidence interval for the true average cost of claims to the insurance company.   You can check your answer using the Tests tab (the confidence interval is included; don't worry about the rest of it).  

Interpret your interval below in one sentence.  





c) Now use your interval to look for evidence for/against your null hypothesis. 





d) What is your final decision?  Do you fail to reject or reject your null hypothesis?  Don't forget to include your alpha value in your answer.





**Second scenario:  We're interested in determining if there is a relationship between cost and the presence/absence of complications.  Specifically,  is the average cost different depending on whether or not a patient has complications?

a) Write down the null and alternative hypotheses.





b) Having already summarized cost, now we need to take a look at complications.

First, summarize the distribution of complications.  Put your graph/table below and describe your distribution in one sentence.





Next, create a graph that shows the relationship (if any) between cost and complications.  Put your graph below and describe in a few sentences.  






Next, calculate the average costs for the patients with complications and the patients without complications (and the standard deviations).  Write one sentence comparing the summary statistics of these two groups.






Now use your summary statistics to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the differences between the two group means.  (Again, you can check your answer with the Tests tab.) 

Report your interval below; interpret it in one sentence.





c) Use your interval to look for evidence of whether or not there is a difference between the average costs of the two groups.





d) Make a decision about the original idea; do you fail to reject or reject your null hypothesis?  Include your alpha value in your answer.






**Third scenario:  We're interested in determining if there is a relationship between the gender of the patient and whether or not there were complications.  For example, is the proportion of males who had complications different than the proportion of females who had complications?

a) Write down the null and alternative hypotheses.





b) Having already summarized complications, now we need to take a look at gender.

First, summarize the distribution of gender.  Put your graph/table below and describe your distribution in one sentence.





Next, create a graph that shows the relationship (if any) between gender and complications.  Put your graph below and describe in a few sentences.  






Next, calculate the sample proportion of males who had complications and the sample proportion of females who had complications.  (Can get the information from the contingency table.)

Write one sentence comparing the summary statistics of these two groups.






Now use your summary statistics to calculate a 99% confidence interval for the differences between the two group proportions.  (Again, you can check your answer with the Tests tab.) 

Report your interval below; interpret it in one sentence.





c) Use your interval to look for evidence of whether or not there is a difference between the proportion with complications for the two gender categories.





d) Make a decision about the original idea; do you fail to reject or reject your null hypothesis?  Include your alpha value in your answer.
